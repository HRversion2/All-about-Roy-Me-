      Hello! My name is Roy Park, a thirteen years old teenager who lives in San
      Diego. Today, I will talk all about myself so that (maybe?) my friends
      will truly know about me.

      I have an older brother who is one year older than me, while my cute
      little sister, who is only four years old. I currently go to the Pacific
      Trails Middle School. My favorite game is Minecraft, both an educational
      and exciting game. My favorite videos are videos of minecraft, such as
      Black Plasma Studios, Rainimator, and minecraft stick figure animation.
      Down below are the stick figure animation made by the popular youtuber,
      Alan becker.

      I was born in 2010, Seoul, Korea. At time I liked a series of an alien car
      moving around and fighting. The title was called 'Mecard', because the
      word mech, and the card was combined. In order to do an attack, they would
      pull up a card, then speak the word so that it would attack. Eventually,
      the game Minecraft struck to my ambitions, and I almost forgot about it,
      until three days ago, when I saw a toy that resembled of the alien,
      Mechanimal.

      I might've stayed there for the rest of my life, but my dad had other
      plans. He wanted for both me and my brother to master english. And so, at
      the age of 8, I went to America, where we settled in California, Sandiego.
      There, I spent the first two years learning the basics about America,
      Ancient Greek myths, and to play tennis, then fencing, as I wanted to do
      it all the time. My parents had intended to stay long enough to learn
      english, then get back to Korea. However, Covid stroked, and we weren't
      able to go. During that time, apparently they've been thinking of a baby,
      because the next thing I knew I had a very adorable baby sister, called
      Rhea. I have many videos that I like, but I would just keep watching
      'Black Plasma Studios' animation over and over again.
